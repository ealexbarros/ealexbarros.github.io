It works! :)

Spent only about 15 min to get this blog up and running.

Using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and started [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). Loved the idea of using git repos to manage my blog (no CMS, no database, no hosting). Simple. Beautiful.

Thanks to Barry Clark for writing [such a great intro tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
